# 🩺 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Healthcare Data  

It demonstrates how to perform **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on healthcare datasets using Python to uncover patterns, trends, and potential insights that can assist in building AI-powered healthcare solutions.  

---

## 🎯 Objectives  
- Understand and clean healthcare datasets.  
- Explore the data using statistical and visual techniques.  
- Identify patterns, correlations, and outliers.  
- Prepare the dataset for future AI/ML model development.  

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used  
- **Python 3.x**  
- **pandas** – For data manipulation and cleaning.  
- **NumPy** – For numerical computations.  
- **Matplotlib** – For creating static visualizations.  
- **Seaborn** – For advanced statistical visualizations.

## 📊 EDA Workflow  
1. **Data Loading** – Reading healthcare datasets into pandas DataFrames.  
2. **Data Cleaning** – Handling missing values, correcting data types, and removing duplicates.  
3. **Summary Statistics** – Using `.describe()` and other methods to understand the dataset.  
4. **Data Visualization** – Creating histograms, scatter plots, box plots, and correlation heatmaps.  
5. **Insight Extraction** – Identifying important trends that could be valuable for healthcare AI models.
